            <p>Pria, the owner of Hair Day, earned her certificate as a colorist and immediately started specializing in
                edgy, custom coloring techniques. She wanted to create a "treat yourself" environment for her clients.
                Pria
                opened the salon with her good friend and talented hairdresser, Garry.</p>
